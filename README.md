# **Experiment 2: Numerical Python (Numpy)**
### Submitted by: **Jihan Harvey C. Casiedo**
### Section: 2ECE-A
---
### **Background of the Experiment**
#### Numpy is a popular core library that is widely used in scientific computing. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object and tools for efficient array manipulation. In addition, it also offers sophisticated broadcasting functions, integration with C/C++ and Fortran code, and useful features for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation.
---
### **Objectives of the Experiment**
#### This experiment aims for students to identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Numpy library and to be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Numpy library.

### **Normalization Problem**
#### Normalization is one of the most basic preprocessing techniques in data analytics. This involves centering and scaling process. Centering means subtracting the data from the mean, and scaling means dividing by its standard deviation. 

Mathematically, normalization can be expressed as: ùëç = (ùëã ‚àí ùë•ÃÖ) / ùúé 

In Python, element-wise mean and element-wise standard deviation can be obtained by using .mean() and .std() calls. 

#### In this problem, a random 5 x 5 ndarray is to be created and stored into variable X. Normalize X. The normalized ndarray is to be saved as X_normalized.npy
---
### **Normalization Code**

``` js
import numpy as np #import numpy

X = np.random.rand(5,5) #create the 5x5 matrix

mean = X.mean() #calculate the mean
std = X.std() #calculate the standard deviation

X_normalized = (X - mean) / std #normalization formula

np.save('X_normalized.npy', X_normalized) #save the array

print("Original array (X):\n", X) #print the values
print("\nNormalized array (X_normalized): \n", X_normalized)
```

#### *Sample Result when running the code:*

### **Divisible by 3 Problem**
#### Create a 10 x 10 ndarray which are the squares of the first 100 positive integers.
From this ndarray, determine all the elements that are divisible by 3. 

Save the result as div_by_3.npy

---
### **Divisible by 3 Code**

``` js
import numpy as np #import numpy

X = np.arange(1, 101).reshape(10, 10) #use arrange to create 1-100 values and use reshape to make into 2D 10x10 matrix

div_by_3 = X[X % 3 == 0] #selects the values that are divisible by 3 using modulo operation

np.save('div_by_3.npy', div_by_3) #save the array

print ("Original matrix: \n", X) #print the values
print ("\nNumbers divisible by 3 from 1-100 are: \n", div_by_3)
```

#### *Sample Result when running the code:*
